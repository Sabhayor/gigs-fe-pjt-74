### Some extra things to keep in mind while coding
Write code for:
1. Readability
- Imagine the person reviewing your code has an axe and knows your house address ðŸ™‚
3. Modularity
- How easy is it to reuse bits of your code?
- When you have an error, how easy is it to narrow down to the exact section of code that's responsible for a problem
4. Efficiency
- How fast does this work?
5. Length
